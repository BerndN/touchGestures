# touchGestures
 Now we can play with finger gestures on the screen.

# The gesture library is used like any other library in LiveCode.

If you don't know how to do it, check the LiveCode dictionary:

• Start using the library

• Backscript

• Frontscript

# The gestures we can handle with this library are:
TouchStillDown, TouchDoubleDown, TouchDoubleUp, PinchStart, PinchMove, PinchZoomingDown, PinchZoomingUp, PinchRotate, PinchEnd, PushLeft, PushRight, PushUp, PushDown, TouchVeryFast, TouchFast, TouchSlow, TouchVerySlow.

For these messages to be placed in the message path of our application. If we use touchStart, touchEnd, touchMove and touchRelease it is necessary to have a pass.
